# GCP Functions

## install gcloud CLI

.. this took a bit of time on my machine as brew does a lot of updates ..

```bash
brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk
```

```bash
gcloud init
```

```bash
gcloud --version
```

## Create Project

```bash
yarn init -i

```

## install dependencies

```bash
yarn add @google-cloud/functions-framework
yarn add -D typescript
```

## Important note

To satisfy typescript i had to install or you might get compilation errors

```bash
@yarnpkg/sdks@3.2.0
```

## Upgrade Yarn to Version 2 or Later: If you havenâ€™t already, upgrade Yarn

```bash
npm install -g yarn@berry
```

## Set Your Project to Use Plug'n'Play

```bash
yarn set version berry
```

.yarnrc.yml should now be in your project

## Install Dependencies: Reinstall the project dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```
